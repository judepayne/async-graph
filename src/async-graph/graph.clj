;; Usually a graph would be expressed as e.g.
;; {f1 #{f2 f3}
;;  f2 #{f4}
;;  f3 #{f4}}
;; but for this project, we need additional node metadata so enrich the
;; data format so a node is expressed like this
;; {f1 {:chdn #{f2 f3} :buf-or-n 5 :ex-handler my-ex-fn etc.. } ..
;; so the below library of graph functions have been amended to work
;; with an accessor, access and a function create for creating the
;; necessary new nodes non-destructively. Setting the below both to
;; identity will accomodate the original format.
